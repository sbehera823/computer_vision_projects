# PSPNet Implementation

## Overview

This module implements PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network), a state-of-the-art deep learning model for semantic segmentation. PSPNet leverages pyramid pooling to capture contextual information at different scales, enabling accurate and detailed segmentation of images. This implementation can be used for various image segmentation tasks, such as urban scene understanding, object segmentation, and more.

## Features

- **Pyramid Pooling Module:** Captures global context information by pooling feature maps at multiple scales.
- **Deep Residual Network Backbone:** Uses ResNet as the backbone network for feature extraction.
- **Auxiliary Loss:** Incorporates an auxiliary loss to improve training stability and performance.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Allows customization of parameters like the number of layers in the backbone, number of classes, and input image size.
