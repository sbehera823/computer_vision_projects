### 1. Simple Neural Network (simple_net.py and simple_net_final.py)

These modules implement a simple neural network from scratch using Python. The network can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. The `simple_net_final.py` module contains the final refined version of the simple neural network, incorporating optimizations and improvements.

### 2. ResNet (my_resnet.py)

This module implements a Residual Network (ResNet), a deep neural network architecture that introduces residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem in very deep networks. ResNet is widely used for image classification and other computer vision tasks due to its effectiveness and performance.
